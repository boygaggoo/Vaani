# Vaani
A Hindi Language Voice Assistant For Android

The popularity of personal assistant artificial intelligences in the wake of 
Apple Inc.’s Siri for the iOS operating system and Microsoft Corporation’s Cortana 
for the Windows Phone operating system has increased to a great extent.
However, such virtual personal assistants have not been available in any Indian languages.

So vyastech presents Vaani, Siri's (wannabe) friend who speaks Hindi. She uses the 
<code>android.speech</code> package to listen to simple Hindi instructions and to
speak in Hindi. 

The project uses a rather simplified method of parsing simple Hindi sentences to 
provide an appropriate response. 

Please note that his is only a working prototype. 


P.S. I'll be a noob-friendly gentleman and add a more descriptive README and also include
comments in my code as soon as I find time to do so.
